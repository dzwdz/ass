<h1>Actually Simple Syndication</h1>
<p>an alternative to "Really Simple" Syndication which tries to actually be simple</p>

<h2>the spec</h2><p>
An .ass file consists of a bunch of lines. Every line represents an item (e.g. article).
<br /><br />
Every line consists of:
<ol>
	<li>an ISO-8601 formatted date with dashes</li>
	<li>the URI of the item</li>
	<li>(optionally) the title of the item</li>
</ol>
Those elements are separated by tabs. Every tab after the URI is treated as part of the title.
The order of the lines doesn't matter.
Additional whitespace before the date is NOT permitted.
<br /><br />
Lines can also be empty or start with the # character. Those lines are to be ignored by clients.
I recommend adding a comment with a link to this page at the top, so people won't get confused about what to do with the file.
<br /><br />
If an .ass extension is too silly for you, you can just use .txt instead.

<h2>benefits over RSS</h2>
<ul>
	<li>doesn't use XML - it's <i>actually</i> simple</li>
	<li>articles can be easily compared/deduplicated</li>
	<li>can be parsed with standard unix tools</li>
</ul>

<h2>software, websites, etc</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://tilde.town/~dzwdz/ass/planet.html">a planet-like feed aggregator.</a> also contains a list of all currently known ass feeds</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/dzwdz/ass">the full git repo.</a> contains e.g. a prototype feed validator, an atom to ass converter</li>
</ul>
