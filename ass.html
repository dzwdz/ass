<h1>Actually Simple Syndication</h1>
<h2>why? or, the part that you can skip</h2><p>
For something called <i>Really Simple</i> Syndication, RSS is really complicated, huh?
Generating an RSS feed can be the most tedious part of making a static site generator.
And if you're making a feed reader, have fun figuring out how to uniquely identify articles!
There's no single good way to do it. tl;dr rss sucks
<br /><br />
Actually Simple Syndication aims to be an alternative to RSS with a truthful name.
</p>

<h2>the spec</h2><p>
An .ass file consists of a bunch of lines. Every line represents an item (e.g. article).
<br /><br />
Every line consists of:
<ol>
	<li>an ISO-8601 formatted date with dashes</li>
	<li>the URI of the item</li>
	<li>(optionally) the title of the item</li>
</ol>
Those elements are separated by tabs. Every tab after the URI is treated as part of the title.
The order of the lines doesn't matter.
Additional whitespace before the date is NOT permitted.
<br /><br />
Lines can also start with the # character. Those lines are to be ignored by clients.
<br /><br />
TODO: figure out a standard filename. fuck the rss filename bullshit
</p>

<h2>examples</h2>
<pre>
# here's an example .ass file
2021-12-30	https://example.com/article-1	Article 1: Something something
2021-04-20	gemini://example.com/brpf
</pre>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# one-liner feed aggregator
curl $(cat feeds.txt) | grep -v ^# | sort
</pre>


<h2>benefits over RSS</h2>
<ul>
	<li>doesn't use XML - it's <i>actually</i> simple</li>
	<li>articles can be easily compared/deduplicated</li>
	<li>so simple you can shit out clients/feed generators at record speed</li>
</ul>
